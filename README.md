# Who am I?

Hello, I'm Daniel Jones and I'm a young passionate Python and C++ Developer. My journey into the world of coding started with curiosity, but quickly turned into my full interest and hobby. I enjoy programming in my free time and hope to have a job as a software engineer in the future. 

I want to find a job as a software engineer, because I can contribute to new projects and collaborate with other professionals to develop new software applications. I believe programming is more than just writing a few lines of code; It‚Äôs about using your imagination and creating things you never thought you could. Like Lego!

In addition to my career goals, I have a desire to work freelance in my spare time after mastering my skills at a high level. Freelancing offers the flexibility to work on different projects, continue learning, and connect with clients around the world. I see this as an opportunity to expand my knowledge in the tech industry and apply my programming skills to a variety of challenges. 

Continuous learning and personal development are important in a programmer‚Äôs journey. I'm excited to take on a role in the software development and contribute my skills to making a positive mark in the technology industry.
